JD's Transmission Patchset
==========================

This is a rather simple patchset I am maintaining because there are several
features/cosmetic changes i'd like to see in the Transmission bittorrent client
that upstream dislikes for one reason or another. Currently, it only makes two
visible changes, but this may change in the future and if it does, i will
update this README file. My changes only affect the GTK client currently.

The changes are:
1. Display the Date Added field for each torrent on the main window.
2. Always show the smaller time remaining even if the larger is above 4.
   
   (ie: if Time Remaining was over 4 hours, it wouldn't show minutes remaining,
   now it will. If Time remaining was over 4 minutes, it wouldn't show seconds,
   now it will. It will only go one smaller unit back though. If there are days
   remaining, it won't show minutes, for example.)


This patchset is based against Transmission SVN trunk revision 11289. It will
likely work with later version and I will test and bump the version
occasionally and fix things when upstream changes break the patch.

Support
-------

I plan to fully support this patchset. If there are any problems, please email
me at the address at the top of the PKGBUILD file or find me on the IRC network
irc.freenode.net usually on either the channel #transmission or #distrocast .
I've usually got my nick as something like jdhore (sometimes jdhore1, sometimes
jdhoreOTG, sometimes jd_ or jd__ (rarely though)

It is quite important to note, however, that I will only be supporting the
changes made by my patch, not all of Transmission. For help with other 
Transmission issues, please see their website for all their support avenues.


Thanks and enjoy the patchset!
